New to Penzene? The [tutorials](tutorials/index.md) walk through complete workflows, from drawing
caffeine with the keyboard to rendering a whole dataset from Python.

The same drawing from a script:

```sh
penzene --render "CC(=O)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)O" aspirin.svg
```

**Chemistry built in**

Live formula and mass, stereo labels, a properties panel, structure checks, and names from PubChem.
:::

:::{container} card
**Figures for papers**

ACS, RSC and JDP styles, reaction schemes, electron-pushing arrows, templates, and exports that reopen as editable drawings.
:::

:::{container} card
**Works with ChemDraw**

Open and save CDXML and CDX, and paste from ChemDraw.
:::

:::{container} card
**Scriptable**

The same engine from [Python](python.md) and the [command line](cli.md).
