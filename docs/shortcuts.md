# Shortcut audit (maintainers' reference, not part of the published docs)

This table checks every entry in ChemDraw 22's
`hotkeys.xml` (the file ChemDraw itself reads), plus the keys on its *Hotkeys
Cheat Sheet*, against Penzene. The full list of Penzene's keys is under
Help → Keyboard Shortcuts (F1).

**Status:** ✓ same · ≈ same idea, different detail · ✗ not in Penzene

## Menu shortcuts that differ

Penzene uses the platform's standard keys (Ctrl on Windows and Linux, ⌘ on macOS)
for File and Edit commands, as ChemDraw does. ⌥⌘C copies as SMILES, as in ChemDraw; Copy
itself carries the picture, MOL and CDX but no plain text, so Office pastes the picture, and
Paste reads any of them, SMILES text included.
