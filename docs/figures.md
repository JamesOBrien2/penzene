# Figures and exports

## Drawing styles

**Structure → Drawing Style** sets a document's style. Exports
come out at the style's real size.

| Style | Bond length | Line | Bold | Double-bond gap | Font |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ACS 1996 (default) | 14.4 pt | 0.6 pt | 2.0 pt | 18% | Arial 10 pt |
| JDP | 14.17 pt (0.5 cm) | 0.879 pt | 1.814 pt | 18% | IBM Plex Sans Light 10 pt |
| RSC | 12.2 pt | 0.449 pt | 1.602 pt | 20% | Helvetica 7 pt |

Preferences sets the style for new documents.

## Export, copy and print

::::{container} features-grid

```{feature} file-export
:title: Export and copy
**File → Export** writes SVG, PNG or PDF of the selection, or of everything. **Copy** puts the same
picture on the clipboard (vector PDF, PNG and SVG) together with MOL, CDX and the Penzene
drawing, so Word, PowerPoint, Keynote and ChemDraw each get what they understand, and Office and
Keynote get sharp vectors rather than pixels. It carries no plain text, so a plain paste into Office
gives the picture; **Edit → Copy as SMILES** (⌥⌘C) gives the text.
```

```{feature} file-type-pdf
:title: Figures that reopen
Exported SVG, PNG and PDF files carry the drawing inside them (a PDF also has the MOL file
attached). Open or paste one back into Penzene and it's editable again, not a picture.
```

```{feature} adjustments
:title: Resolution, background and scale
**Preferences** sets the PNG resolution, a clear or white background, a scale (e.g. 85% to fit a
journal column) and a margin.
```

```{feature} printer
:title: Print
**File → Print** prints at the same size as an export, centred on the page.
```

```{feature} moon
:title: Light and dark
The canvas can follow the system's light or dark mode or use a theme (**View → Theme**). Exports
are always black on clear or white.
```

## Page mode

**View → Page** shows a page on the canvas: A4, US Letter, or an ACS or RSC single or double
column at the journal's maximum figure height. Lay a scheme out at its final size; Export, Copy and
Print then take the whole page. A selection still exports just itself.

## Reaction schemes

Draw molecules either side of a reaction arrow, with reagents over or under it, and use
**Structure → Arrange Scheme** to line them up. **Edit → Copy as Reaction SMILES** and saving as
`.rxn` treat everything before the arrow as reactants, things over or under it as agents, and
things after it as products.

```{image} _static/scheme-light.png
:alt: A reaction scheme: salicylic acid to aspirin with Ac₂O and H₂SO₄ over the arrow
:class: shot only-light
```

```{image} _static/scheme-dark.png
:alt: A reaction scheme: salicylic acid to aspirin with Ac₂O and H₂SO₄ over the arrow, dark theme
:class: shot only-dark
```
